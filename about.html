      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Phoenix Racing is the official ATV team of Sri
Ramakrishna Engineering College, Coimbatore.
Since 2012, weâ€™ve built and raced All-Terrain
Vehicles, driven by a passion for motorsports and
engineering.
Through events like eBAJA SAEINDIA and Mega
ATV, we apply what we learn in class to real-world
challenges. From design to fabrication, each stage
helps us grow as engineers and teammates,
staying true to our goal of building better buggies
every season.
BAJA SAEINDIA is a prestigious Collegiate Design Series
competition organized by SAEINDIA, with support from
industry leaders like Mahindra & Mahindra and ARAI. The
event challenges engineering students across India to
design, build, and race durable All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs)
capable of performing in extreme off-road conditions.
Held over five days, the competition includes a
series of Static and Dynamic events, culminating in
a demanding Endurance race. BAJA SAEINDIA
offers students a hands-on platform to apply
engineering knowledge, innovate under pressure,
and develop vital skills in design, manufacturing,
teamwork, and project management.</p>
